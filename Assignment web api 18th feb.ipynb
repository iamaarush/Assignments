    "# Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Some advantages of APIs are - \n",
    "\n",
    "Applications - access to APIs ensure more flexibility in information transfer process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reach - APIs let you create layers in apps inorder to distribute information to different audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customization -  Firthermore it can serve as a solution to create different experience for users , letting protocols ,\n",
    "functions and commands be adapted according to specific demands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency - When you have content that is automatically published and made available on different channels \n",
    "simultaneously APIs allow for more efficient data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaptability - One of the greatest benefits of APIs is the abality it has to adapt to changes through data migration\n",
    "and flexibilty of services.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some disadvantages of APIs are -\n",
    "\n",
    "Security concerns - API infrastructure can be vulnerable to security breaches such as SQL injection attacks and \n",
    "cross site scripting attacks making it crucial to implement security measures to protect against these threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity - APIs can be complex requiring a significant amount of developement effort to implement and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compatibilty issues - APIs can have compatability issues between differnt versions of the same software system \n",
    "or between differnt systems which can lead to errors and system failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependency on third party developers - APIs rely on third party developers to create applications that integrate with the \n",
    "software system. This can create dependencies that are outside of the control of the company that owns the software syytem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Governance and management - APIs require proper governance and management to ensure they are being used correctly and \n",
    "consistently across different applications and systems."
