    "Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are both encoding techniques used in data preprocessing, but \n",
    "they differ in the type of data they are best suited for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding is a technique that assigns a unique numerical value to each categorical variable in a\n",
    "dataset. For example, if we have a categorical variable \"color\" with the values \"red\", \"green\", and \n",
    "\"blue\", we can encode them as 0, 1, and 2, respectively. Label Encoding does not take into account any \n",
    "ordering or hierarchy in the categorical variables, and the encoded values are arbitrary.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Ordinal Encoding is a technique that assigns numerical values to categorical variables\n",
    "based on their order or hierarchy. For example, if we have a categorical variable \"size\" with the values \n",
    "\"small\", \"medium\", and \"large\", we can encode them as 0, 1, and 2, respectively. In this case, the encoded\n",
    "values reflect the order of the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use Ordinal Encoding versus Label Encoding depends on the specific context and the nature of the \n",
    "categorical variable being encoded. If the categorical variable has a natural ordering or hierarchy, such\n",
    "as in the case of \"size\", then Ordinal Encoding may be more appropriate. On the other hand, if the \n",
    "categorical variable has no inherent ordering, such as in the case of \"color\", then Label Encoding may be\n",
    "more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we were encoding data for a clothing store, we might use Ordinal Encoding for the \"size\"\n",
    "variable, as there is a natural ordering to the sizes. However, for the \"color\" variable, we would use \n",
    "Label Encoding, as there is no inherent order to the colors.\n"

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables based on their\n",
    "relationship with the target variable in a supervised machine learning problem. The basic idea is\n",
    "to assign a numerical value to each category of the categorical variable based on the mean or \n",
    "median target value for that category. The categories with the highest target value are assigned \n",
    "the highest numerical value, and the categories with the lowest target value are assigned the \n",
    "lowest numerical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we have a dataset of customer information for a bank, including a categorical \n",
    "variable \"education\" with categories \"high school\", \"college\", and \"graduate school\", and a target \n",
    "variable indicating whether or not the customer defaulted on a loan. To perform Target Guided Ordinal\n",
    "Encoding, we would group the data by each category of \"education\" and calculate the mean or median \n",
    "target value for each group. We would then assign a numerical value to each category based on its \n",
    "mean or median target value. The category with the highest target value would be assigned the highest\n",
    "numerical value, and the category with the lowest target value would be assigned the lowest numerical \n",
    "value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a machine learning project, Target Guided Ordinal Encoding can be used when the categorical variable\n",
    "has a strong relationship with the target variable and the goal is to improve the predictive power of\n",
    "the model. For example, if we are building a model to predict customer loan default, the \"education\" \n",
    "variable may be a good candidate for Target Guided Ordinal Encoding, as it is likely to be a strong\n",
    "predictor of loan default. By encoding the variable based on its relationship with the target, we may \n",
    "be able to improve the accuracy of our model. However, it is important to note that Target Guided \n",
    "Ordinal Encoding can lead to overfitting if not used carefully, and should be used in conjunction \n",
    "with other encoding techniques and feature selection methods."

    "    1. Gender: One-Hot Encoding is a good choice for the \"Gender\" variable because there are \n",

    "    each possible value, where a 1 indicates the presence of that value and 0 indicates its \n",

    "    hierarchy between its possible values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Education Level: Ordinal Encoding or Label Encoding could be used for the \"Education Level\" \n",
    "    variable since there is a natural order between the possible values (High School < Bachelor's \n",
    "    < Master's < PhD). Ordinal Encoding assigns a numerical value to each category in a way the \n",
    "    preserves the order between them, whereas Label Encoding assigns a numerical value arbitrarily. \n",
    "    If the order between categories is important for the machine learning algorithm, then Ordinal \n",
    "    Encoding would be a better choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Employment Status: One-Hot Encoding could be used for the \"Employment Status\" variable since\n",
    "    there are three possible values (Unemployed, Part-Time, Full-Time) and no natural order or \n",
    "    hierarchy between them. One-Hot Encoding creates a binary column for each possible value, where\n",
    "    a 1 indicates the presence of that value and 0 indicates its absence. This method is particularly \n",
    "    useful when the categorical variable has no order or hierarchy between its possible values.\n",
